# DataMiningSpotifyProject
The project can be found in Maaster branch.

The ideas ðŸ’¡:

Using machine learning algorithm and my personal Spotify playlists to understand which type of genres is most suited for dancing and getting the groove on.
Also using Naive Bayes algorithm to predict genres for playlist.
